# Machine-Learning-Group-Project

This repository contains research by authors: Sommer Harris, Ian Yip, Mitchell Lawson, and David Maunder.

Our research project was to use linear regression to develop a model that can predict covid-19 infection rates. We conducted this project, over a few months, in order to better understand more about how machine learning can be used to model epidemics.
